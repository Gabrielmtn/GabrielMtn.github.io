        <div style = "text-align:center;">Okay. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">I'm going to give you some exercises that may help, and you're going to have to take a deep breath, sit down, and accept that no one's house is like the ones on TV, unless they are really doing nothing but cleaning, nonstop</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Part of the problem is that you don't see the clutter. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Really. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You're in the habit of not seeing it- and when you DO see it, there's so much it's overwhelming. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">So you're going to have to learn two things. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">One, to see more clearly. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Two, to handle the anxiety that all the clutter brings. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Because that's why you don't see it- when you do, it's painful. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">So your brain, with all it's clever ways of avoiding pain, is taking the shortcut and not seeing it</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Here's what you're going to do</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You're going to stop thinking of this as an all-or-nothing thing, and you're going to start by doing three things a day. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Just three, and you'll do them every day. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Make a chart and give yourself stars, if you want to. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Whatever helps. </div>


<div style = "text-align:center;">But these three things, they have to be small and simple. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Just three things. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Anyone can do three things. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">The object is to get you into the habit of these three things until they feel normal to you, and it will give you the sense of having done something, which will really help</div>


<div style = "text-align:center;">Think about good self-care, small rewards that you can do after cleaning. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Like you clean for fifteen minutes- just fifteen- and then sit and read a book for half an hour. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Then another fifteen minutes of calmly removing clutter. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Don't do it all day, but start it in small amounts, and in a small area</div>

<div style = "text-align:center;">Think of it as clearing a petri dish full of mold- you put the penicillin in one spot continuously till it's clear, and then keep adding it there until it spreads out across the dish. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">In this case, it's your home. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Start with ONE area, whether it's the sink or one counter-top, and get it clear. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Keep it clear. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Don't think of it as removing clutter, think of it as building space. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You will still freak out at the giant mess. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Learn not to. </div>



<div style = "text-align:center;">Cultivate an attitude of patience with yourself, and say, "Your turn will come" to the rest of it. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Focus on the small space, and build a clean spot there.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">By focusing on the clean spots you're building, you'll be able to enjoy having them clear more. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">And it will really help with the rest.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Just say, "your turn will come," and tackle the next area once your one corner/sink/counter-top has been clean for a week.</div>

<div style = "text-align:center;">Meanwhile, when you pick up items to decide whether you want them? Think about whether YOU would buy it at a yard sale. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Whether you would look for a replacement if it weren't there. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Including papers- if you lost this paper in a house fire, would you need to find another copy somewhere? Yes, because it's a bank account you don't have online access to. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Okay, file that one and keep it. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">This one you have online access to, so you don't need the paper? Shred it and move on. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">There, you lost it in an imaginary house fire and don't have to worry about it any more. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You'll be amazed what you wouldn't replace.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">It's about learning a new framework for owning things, keeping only what adds to your life in a positive way. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">If it represents a potential project, something you hope one day you'll do? Give yourself ONE box for those, and when it's full, you can't add anything else unless you get rid of something in it. </div>

<div style = "text-align:center;">You'll find, over time, that you need fewer and fewer "potential" things, because you'll have space to work on the things you do care about.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You're not demolishing the mess. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You're building the space you deserve.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">This is an important distinction, because it helps keep it in perspective. </div>

<div style = "text-align:center;">You're choosing, out of what you have, what kind of life you're going to build.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Don't be afraid to seek out a counselor, either. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">I'm betting your spouse won't go, but there's no reason you shouldn't. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">It will really help to have someone to work through the issues with, who can help you with ways to deal with the anxiety. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Because the anxiety is terrible, isn't it? It's the worst part, that flat panic when you turn and really see the mess.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Don't expect perfection. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Expect progress. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Slow, good progress, as you change and learn how you want to keep the place. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You'll have weeks when you slip. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Don't give up, go back to those three things you started with, and keep going. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">It gets easier over time.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">And then you will start doing a fifteen minute sweep every day, just wander around with a bag and throw away thirty things. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Spend a few minutes clearing your counter/sink/corner/whatever. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Keep that area clean.</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">Don't worry about most of the work falling on you. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You're learning to do this, and he will have to be patient while you do- and so will you. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You've done the hardest part, which is admitting it and starting to see. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">It gets easier. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">It takes practice. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You'll be learning for years. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">It's okay.</div>


<div style = "text-align:center;">(Including laundry.)</div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">You'll be working towards getting together a system. </div>
<div style = "text-align:center;">So start with three things a day, and work from there.</div>
