# Animate.css
*Just-add-water CSS animation*

**PSA: This is the `gh-pages` branch, home of the Animate.css website. To download the latest version of Animate.css, switch to the `master` branch.**

## Contributing to the Animate.css website
The Animate.css website is a simple little one-pager. When you add an animation to the master branch in a pull request, you should open a second pull request adding the animation to the website.
