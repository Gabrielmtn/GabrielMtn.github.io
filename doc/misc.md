## .gitignore

HTML5 Boilerplate includes a basic project-level `.gitignore`. This should
primarily be used to avoid certain project-level files and directories from
being kept under source control. Different development-environments will
benefit from different collections of ignores.

OS-specific and editor-specific files should be ignored using a "global
ignore" that applies to all repositories on your system.

For example, add the following to your `~/.gitconfig`, where the `.gitignore`
in your HOME directory contains the files and directories you'd like to
globally ignore:

```gitignore
[core]
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
```

### `crossdomain.xml`

The _cross-domain policy file_ is an XML document that gives a web client —
such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader, etc. — permission to handle data
across multiple domains, by:

 * granting read access to data
 * permitting the client to include custom headers in cross-domain requests
 * granting permissions for socket-based connections

__e.g.__ If a client hosts content from a particular source domain and that
content makes requests directed towards a domain other than its own, the remote
domain would need to host a cross-domain policy file in order to grant access
to the source domain and allow the client to continue with the transaction.

For more in-depth information, please see Adobe's [cross-domain policy file
specification](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html).
