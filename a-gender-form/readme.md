# a simple friggin gender form

i'm so tired of seeing "trans" in any form about gender. you cissies don't know what you're talking about.

it's not even hard. use a typeahead prepopulated with some genders, like "man" and "agender". "trans" is not a gender, fuck you, quit misunderstanding.

if yer gender isn't in the prepopulated options, enter your own! nobody's gonna stop you. not even you, identifies-as-an-attack-helicopter, ya lil fascist.

the included 'genders.txt' is very basic. i invite pull requests that add more options.

check the source, credit the authors, and do yer friggin homework!
